My React learning project where my main focus has been on mastering React functionality rather than getting deep into design. While I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS, I wouldn't call myself a design expert. To keep things simple and efficient, I’ve been using Tailwind CSS throughout the project, which I’m most comfortable with. Most of the CSS has been sourced with a little help from ChatGPT, as my priority was on the React functionality rather than perfecting the design.
